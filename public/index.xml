      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s free, fast, and easy to manage: three reasons why I decided to deploy this Hugo site using Cloudflare Pages. Hugo is a static site generator and content management system that allows users to write content in markdown. Cloudflare pages is a free static site hosting service that ensures your site loads quickly from anywhere in the world.

Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of some terraform code that could be used to create a storage bucket in Google Cloud Platform.</description>

      <description>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal website! I&amp;rsquo;m James Albritton, a software developer specializing in cloud infrastructure. Most recently, I was a software engineer in the platform product group at WP Engine, and prior to that, I was a software engineer in corporate IT at Dell Technologies.
In both roles, the teams worked across GCP, Azure, and AWS clouds. At Dell, I built a service broker which provisions GCP projects for internal development teams using C#.</description>
