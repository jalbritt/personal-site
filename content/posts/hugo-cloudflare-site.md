It's free, fast, and easy to manage: three reasons why I decided to deploy this Hugo site using Cloudflare pages. Hugo is a static site generator and content management system that allows users to write content in markdown. Cloudflare pages is a free static site hosting service that ensures your site loads quickly from anywhere in the world.

- Step 1: [Hugo Quickstart](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
- Step 2: [Deploy a Hugo Site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/)

Those are the steps! Now you can import any markdown docs you already have as content for your site. Additionally, your site content is now more portable than content written in html. Advanced Hugo users are free to create their own themes, or modify existing themes to suit their own preferred design. Read more at https://gohugo.io/ and https://pages.cloudflare.com/.
