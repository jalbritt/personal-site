Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal website! I'm James Albritton, a software developer specializing in cloud infrastructure. Most recently, I was a software engineer in the platform product group at [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/platform/), and prior to that, I was a software engineer in corporate IT at [Dell Technologies](https://www.dell.com/).

In both roles, the teams worked across GCP, Azure, and AWS clouds. At Dell, I built a service broker which provisions GCP projects for internal development teams using C#. At WP Engine, I worked on production infrastructure and supporting systems--as well as internal infrastructure components and access. I have experience with a wide range of tasks related to software development, site reliability engineering, and DevOps. Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/jalbritt) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/albrittonjames/).
